				Welcome to the webserver of TB-Profiler - a pipeline which allows users
				to analyse <i>M. tuberculosis</i> whole genome sequencing data to
				predict lineage and drug resistance. Follow the instructions below to
				upload a new sample or view analysed runs.
			</div>



			<h6 class="">How does it work?</h6>
			<div class="pb-4">
				The pipeline searches for small variants and big deletions associated
				with drug resistance. It will also report the lineage. By default it
				uses Trimmomatic to trim the reads, BWA (or minimap2 for nanopore) to
				align to the reference genome and GATK (open source v4) to call variants.

			<h6 class="pt-4">Which mutations are being used to prodict resistance?</h6>
			<div class="pb-4">
				Resistance is predicted using the curated <a href="https://github.com/jodyphelan/tbdb">tbdb database</a>.
				This database has been tested using over 17,000 samples with genptypic and
				phenotypic data. You can read more about the markers present in the library
				at the time of testing <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-019-0650-x">here</a> or you can take a look at the
				up to date CSV file <a href="https://github.com/jodyphelan/tbdb/blob/master/tbdb.csv">here</a>.
